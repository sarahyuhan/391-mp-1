                        Hi! I am a senior at Boston University pursuing a B.A. in Computer Science, with a strong interest in coding, consulting, machine learning, and statistics. 
                        I am also a strong advocate for LGBTQIA+ and queer rights, and am dedicated to bringing awareness to the challenges that queer individuals face. I am eager to expand my knowledge in technology and seek opportunities that will allow me to apply my skills in analytical thinking, organization, project management, and knowledge in data science and data analysis. Additionally, I am interested in exploring the consulting field further and leveraging my interdisciplinary background to make meaningful contributions.
